The Bookstore API is a Flask-based web service designed to serve as a virtual bookstore, allowing users to browse available books, retrieve specific book details, add new books, update existing book information, and delete books from the inventory. The API provides simple yet essential endpoints for interacting with book data via HTTP requests.
